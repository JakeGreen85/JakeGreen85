Experience
-
  - 🧱 Breakout (C#)
    - Created a Breakout game for a school project. The game uses the DIKUArcade game engine developed by the Computer Science department of the University of Copenhagen. Breakout was developed throughout the Software Development course, which prepared us for our final project: Galaga.
  - 👾 Galaga (C#)
    - Created a Galaga game for a school project. This game also uses the DIKUArcade game engine. This game was our final project for the Software Development course.
  - ⚔️ RPG Game (Pixel art) (C#)
    - Created an RPG game using Unity. The game has top-down perspective and has pixel artstyle.
  - 🏈 Football Playbook Website for youth team (HTML + CSS)
    - Created a website for the youth team that I coach. I was not satisfied with the tools I had at my disposal for sharing the playbook with my team, so I created and setup a website that displayed the information I wanted and how I wanted.
  - 🤖 Robot Lab (Python)
    - Programmed an autonomous robot for a school project. The course had us code different algorithms for self-localization and path finding, and finished with a race through an obstacle course, where we used what we learned to go through the course as fast as possible. My group finished 1st in the race.🥇
  - ⚔️ Turn-based RPG game (Python + PyGame)
    - Created a turn-based RPG game using python and pygame, that features character stats (health, mana, xp, gold, etc.), fighting in different zones, shops, blacksmith, inventory, and more.

Current Projects
-
  - ⚔️ 3D RPG Game (to be extended with Steam Multiplayer API) (C#)
    - Working on a 3D RPG game. This project is based on my experience that I gained from the pixel art RPG game. This game is much more complex, as it will have multiple character classes and will be extended with the Steam Multiplayer API, so you can create a lobby and play with your friends.
  - 🎮 VR Games (C#)
    - Enrolled in a Virtual Reality course at KU and started developing VR games.
